# Decentralizing Parameter Control in Third-Party Applications

This white paper introduces a groundbreaking approach to user interaction with third-party applications. The core idea is the development of a decentralized application and a Software Development Kit (SDK) that empowers users by giving them complete control over the parameters used by third-party applications in content suggestion. The decentralized application is designed to store these user-defined parameters securely and privately, while the SDK ensures seamless integration with third-party applications. The unique aspect of this approach is that the required parameters can be specified by the third-party applications themselves, providing a flexible and customizable user experience. This project stands at the intersection of decentralization, user control, and seamless integration, aiming to redefine the way users interact with third-party applications.
