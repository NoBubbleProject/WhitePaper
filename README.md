# Decentralizing Parameter Control in Third-Party Applications

## Abstract
This white paper unveils an innovative strategy aimed at revolutionizing user engagement with third-party applications. At the heart of this strategy is a decentralized application coupled with a Software Development Kit (SDK), designed to grant users unprecedented control over parameters that influence content suggestions. The decentralized application ensures secure and private storage of user-defined parameters, while the SDK enables smooth integration with third-party applications. A key feature of this system is its adaptability, allowing third-party applications to define the necessary parameters, thereby tailoring the user experience. This project, situated at the crossroads of decentralization, user empowerment, and seamless integration, aspires to alter the dynamics of user interaction with third-party applications. The overarching objective is to mitigate the pervasive issue of social bubbles and promote informed content consumption.
